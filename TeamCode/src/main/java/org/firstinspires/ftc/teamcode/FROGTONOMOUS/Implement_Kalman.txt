Plans to implement Kalman filter

Run 1d Kalman on x,y,heading (Treat them as independent for now because coupled version is hard to implement)

------- FOR X --------
x = initial_estimate
p = initial_variance
q = model covariance
r = sensor covariance

while true:
    u = get_model_output() //from odometry
    x_pred = x + u
    p_pred = p + q

    //update

    z = get_sensor_output() //from limelight camera

    K = p_pred / (p_pred + r)
    x = x_pred + K * (z - x_pred)
    p = (1 - K) * p_pred
